<strong>Scope</strong> the visibility or accessibility of variables from different parts of the program.

In JavaScript we have Function Scope and Lexical Scoping

<strong>Function Scope</strong>Function Scope means that any variable which is defined within a function is visible within that entire function.This is quite different form Block Scope. <strong>How??</strong>



<strong>Lexical Scoping</strong> defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions.

Other names of Lexical Scoping are <strong>Static Scoping or  Closure</strong>

It means that the scope of an inner function contains the scope of a parent function.


what makes Lexical Scoping so powerful: inner functions contain the scope of parent functions even <strong> if the parent function has returned.</strong>

<strong>Conclusionly:Inner functions contain the scope of parent functions even if the parent function has returned.</strong>

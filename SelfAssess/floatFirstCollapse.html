		<!-- not get desired result that is image on the right side -->

		<!-- So... First, a rule that I have found that works nicely for my layouts is float first. That is, in my HTML, I almost always place my floated elements first in the markup, and before any non-floated elements that my float will interact with, such as the paragraph in the example above. Most of the time, this gives the desired result. Second, the reason that the image is seemingly sticking out of the bottom of our #container element has to do with something called collapsing. Let’s talk about what collapsing is and how we can best address it. -->



		<!-- collapsing occur..when elelemnt are removed from the flow.. -->

		<!-- Collapsing is when a parent element that contains any number of floated elements doesn’t expand to completely surround those elements in the way it would if the elements were not floated. In Example I above, our parent element, #container, collapsed as if the floated img element wasn’t even there.  -->

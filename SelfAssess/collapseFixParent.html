		<p>This is some text contained within a small-ish box. I'm using it as an example of how placing your floated elements in different orders in your HTML can affect your layouts. For example, take a look at this great photo placeholder that should be sitting on the right.</p>
		<img src="images.jpg" />
		<!-- One of the most common ways to fix a collapsed parent element is to place an element with the clear property after our floated element-->
		<div style="clear: right;"></div>
		<!-- same clear as the element!!!!!!....Focused.-->
	</div>


	<!-- By placing a div with an inline style of clear: right we’ve managed to get our #container to clear our floated image by having it recalculate its height now that there’s an element sitting below it. While this solution works, it may not be the most elegant because we had to add extra markup to our document. It would have been sexier to handle this with CSS. There are a few ways to do that, so let’s take a look at one of them right now.-->

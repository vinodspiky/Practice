<!-- in CSS, we work within boundaries. In CSS, this boundary is called the normal flow -->

<!-- Boxes in the normal flow belong to a formatting context, which may be block or inline, but not both simultaneously. Block boxes participate in a block formatting context. Inline boxes participate in an inline formatting context. -->

<!-- You can use the static value for simple, single-column layouts where each element must sit on top of the next one. If you want to start shifting those elements around using offset properties such as top, right, bottom, and left, you’re out of luck. These properties are unavailable to a static element. In fact, a static element can’t even create a new coordinate system for child elements. -->

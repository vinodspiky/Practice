<!-- A benefit of using a Google hosted version of jQuery is that it is reliable, fast, and potentially
cached. -->


<!--As of jQuery 1.3, the library no longer guarantees that all CSS files are loaded before it fires the
custom ready() event..So...Include all CSS files before including jQuery  -->

<!-- Using the non-minified variant
during development, as debugging errors is always easier when you are dealing with nonminified
code. -->

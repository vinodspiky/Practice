<!-- Remarks:This should only be used in extreme cases
because it will, more than likely, cause issues with jQuery plugins. -->

<!-- noConflict() method, which has several usesâ€”namely, the ability to
replace $ with another alias -->

<!-- Benefits:
	It can relinquish the use of the $
sign to another library, help avoid potential conflicts, and provide the ability to customize the
namespace/alias for the jQuery object.



For example, let's say that you are building a Web application for company XYZ. It might be nice
to customize jQuery so that instead of having to use jQuery('div').show() or
$('div').show() you could use XYZ('div').show() instead.

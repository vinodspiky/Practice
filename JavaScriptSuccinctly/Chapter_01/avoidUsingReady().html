<!-- To avoid using the ready() event for code that operates on the DOM, you can simply place
your code in an HTML document before the closing </body> element. -->


<!-- Doing so ensures the
DOM is completely loaded, simply because the browser will parse the document from top to
bottom. If you place your JavaScript code in the document after the DOM elements it
manipulates, there is no need to use the ready() event. -->



<!-- Remarks:  Placing jQuery code at the bottom
of the page avoids having to using the ready() event. In fact, placing all JavaScript code at the
bottom of a page is a proven performance strategy. -->

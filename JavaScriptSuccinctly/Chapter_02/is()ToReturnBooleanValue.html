<!-- Notes:
As of jQuery 1.3, the is() method supports all expressions. Previously, complex expressions
such as those containing hierarchy selectors (such as +, ~, and >) always returned true.
Filter is used by other internal jQuery functions. Therefore, all rules that apply there, apply
here, as well.
Some developers use is('.class') to determine if an element has a specific class. Don't
forget that jQuery already has a method for doing this called hasClass('class'), which can
be used on elements that contain more than one class value. But truth be told, hasClass()
is just a convenient wrapper for the is() method. -->

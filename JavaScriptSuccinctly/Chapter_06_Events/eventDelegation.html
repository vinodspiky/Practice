<!-- Event delegation relies on event propagation (a.k.a. bubbling). When you click an <a> inside of
a <li>, which is inside of a <ul>, the click event bubbles up the DOM from the <a> to the <li>
to the <ul> and so on, until each ancestor element with a function assigned to an event handler
fires.
This means if we attach a click event to a <ul> and then click an <a> that is encapsulated inside
of the <ul>, eventually the click handler attached to the <ul>, because of bubbling, will be
invoked. When it is invoked, we can use the event object (event.target) to identify which
element in the DOM actually caused the event bubbling to begin. Again, this will give us a
reference to the element that started the bubbling. -->

<!-- Now, if you were to literally click on one of the actual bullets of the list and not the link itself,
guess what? You'll end up removing the <ul>. Why? Because all clicks bubble. So when you
click on the bullet, the event.target is the <li>, not the <a>. Since this is the case, the
parent() method will grab the <ul> and remove it. We could update our code so that we only
remove an <li> when it is being clicked from an <a> by passing the parent() method an
element expression.
$(event.target).parent('li').remove(); -->

<!-- 
jQuery normalizes the event object according to W3C standards. This means that when the
event object is passed to a function handler, you do not have to worry about browser-specific
implementations of the event object (e.g. Internet Explorerâ€™s window.event). You can use the
following attributes and methods of the event object worry-free from browser differences
because jQuery normalizes the event object. -->

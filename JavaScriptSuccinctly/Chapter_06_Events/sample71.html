<!-- After examining the code, it should be obvious that we are using live() to apply event
delegation to a parent element (<body> element in the code example) so that any button
element added to the DOM always responds to the click handler.


To remove the live event, we simply use the die() methodâ€”e.g. $('button').die().

The concept to take away is the live() method could be used to attach events to DOM
elements that are removed and added using AJAX. In this way, you would forgo having to
rebind events to new elements introduced into the DOM after the initial page load.
Notes:
live() supports the following handlers: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove,
mouseover, mouseout, keydown, keypress, keyup.
live() only works against a selector.
live() by default will stop propagation by using return false within the function sent to the
live() method.

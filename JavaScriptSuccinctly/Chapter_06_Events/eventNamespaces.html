<!--Often we will have an object in the DOM that needs to have several functions tied to a single
event handler. For example, let's take the resize handler. Using jQuery, we can add as many
functions to the window.resize handler as we like. But what happens when we need to remove
only one of these functions but not all of them? If we use $(window).unbind('resize'), all
functions attached to the window.resize handler will be removed. By namespacing a handler
(e.g. resize.unique), we can assign a unique hook to a specific function for removal.
